## How to Join
We accept new members from September to mid-November or from May to the end of school.

# There are two ways that you can join the team:
1. Talk to a coach
  * Mr. Barron - Talk to him in person in the science office or send him an email at [BarronT@fpsct.org](mailto:barront@fpsct.org)
  * Mrs. Hall - Talk to her in person in the math office or send her an email at [HallM@fpsct.org](mailto:hallm@fpsct.org)
2. Email [ContactUs@FarmingtonRobotics.org](contactus@farmingtonrobotics.org)

# **After doing one of the above, please fill out the following forms.**
**Note:** You must print the two forms out, fill them out *legibly*, scan them into your computer, turn them into a single .pdf file ([help with this](#pdf-help)), upload that file to Google Drive, and share it with [Trips@FarmingtonRobotics.org](trips@farmingtonrobotics.org).

# <a name="pdf-help"></a>How to scan papers and turn them into a .pdf.
You can either use your home printer/scanner to turn your forms into .pdfs or you can use a mobile app. There is one for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thegrizzlylabs.geniusscan.free&hl=en" target="_blank">Android</a> and one for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/genius-scan-pdf-scanner/id377672876?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> (iPhones & iPods).

# After You've Joined
Head over to other pages in the Members Section to learn how to join our emailing list, how to get access the shared Google Drive Folder, what additional forms you need to fill out, and much more.
