## Communication
If you have general questions email {% include obfuscated-email.html %}

# Email the Coaches
* Mr. Barron - [BarronT@fpsct.org](mailto:barront@fpsct.org)
* Mrs. Hall - [HallM@fpsct.org](mailto:hallm@fpsct.org)

# <a name="mail-list"></a>Join our Mailing List
There are two mailing lists; they're both managed by Google Groups. To join, you'll have to send an email to one of the addresses below.

* One is for the parents - ([Farmington-Robotics-Team-Parents+subscribe@GoogleGroups.com](mailto:farmington-robotics-team-parents+subscribe@googlegroups.com))
* One is for the students - ([FarmingtonRobotics+subscribe@GoogleGroups.com](mailto:farmingtonrobotics+subscribe@googlegroups.com))

After sending the email you'll receive a response with a button in it. If you're a parent everything should work fine when you click the button. **However**, if you're a student who's joining using their *school email address* to join, clicking the button won't work. Instead, you'll have to reply to the email that contains the button. The message doesn't really matter, as long as you say that you want to join.

**If you're neither a parent nor a student but still want to receive updates you can follow our team FaceBook page
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/181303461902744/?fref=nf" target="_blank">here</a>.**

# What Now?
Now that you're on the mailing list there are a couple of things you can do. You can learn about [safety]({{ site.url }}/members/safety/#safety) on the team, read the [handbook]({{ site.url }}/members/handbook/#handbook), or (if you're a student) get added to the team's [Google Drive shared folder]({{ site.url }}/members/drive/#drive).
