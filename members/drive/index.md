## Team Shared Folder
The Enforcers store files and documents in a Google Drive folder that is shared with everyone on the team. The settings are linked to the email list. To be added to the folder, you need to click the button below and click "Add to Drive." Make sure you are signed into the Google account that is on our emailing list. If you aren't on the list go <a href="{{ site.url }}/members/communication/#mail-list" target="_blank">here</a> and then come back.
After you've been added, you should add the folder to your <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375043?hl=en" target="_blank">drive</a>.
