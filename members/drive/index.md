## Google Drive Folder
The Enforcers store files and documents in a shared Google Drive folder. The settings are linked to the email list. To be added to the folder, you need to click the button below and click "Add to Drive." Make sure you are signed into the Google account that is on our emailing list. If you aren't on the list go <a href="{{ site.url }}/members/communication/#mail-list" target="_blank">here</a> and then come back.
After you've been added, you should add the folder to your <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375043?hl=en" target="_blank">drive</a>.
