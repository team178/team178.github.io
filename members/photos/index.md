## How to Submit Photos
If you're on this page then you've probably taken some pictures of/for us and want to give them to us somehow. If you're a student who has access to the Google Drive [Shared Folder]({{ site.url }}/members/drive/#drive){:target="_blank"} you should put the pictures in the proper folder inside of "This Year's Media"

However, if you don't have access you should email [DigitalMedia@FarmingtonRobotics.org](mailto:digitalmedia@farmingtonrobotics.org) and ask for further instructions.
