## Events
Dream FIRST events are run similar to a science fair. We visit a variety of locations, including elementary schools, and aim to inspire kids through a process of exploration and discovery.

Dream FIRST stations are designed for kids to become interested in fields of science and technology. The Dream FIRST motto, "Dream, Explore, Aspire" represents the basis of our experiments. While we have a wide repertoire of activities for kids and their parents to participate in, not every event is the same. Here are some examples of stations we have used:
