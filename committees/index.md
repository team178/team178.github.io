## Committees

### Engineering Committee of Representatives (eCOR)

#### Electrical
During pre-season, electrical teaches new members what things are and how they work. Sometimes, this is done by fixing or re-wireing previous robots. Time is also spent looking around the shop and ordering new parts to be ready the build our next robot. During build season, Electrical works with designing the new robot to make sure there is room for the electrical board, and other electrical components. They also make sure that what we come up with during the designing process will be possible to set up and run within our time constraints. In post-season, time is spent restoring or fixing old robots, or helping out other committees.

#### Mechanical
In build season, Mechanical physically puts together most of the robot or organizes what other committees are working on for the robot. During off-season, Mechanical spends a lot of time fixing past robots or cleaning and organizing the shop area.

#### Programming
Most of programming's time is spent programming the robots, whether it is our current robot for this year's game, re-writing or improving code for past robots, or creating special code that make it safe for kids to try driving the "big bot" at things like our Dream FIRST events.

#### Robot Support
Robot Support leads and manages all building projects. They also draw rough drafts and do the majority of rough board work for all other committees. Robot Suport organizes the shop and helps build committee's areas by doing basic carpentry work and that needs to be done for the team.
