*FIRST* Lego League Junior, previously known as Jr. FLL, is a branch of *FIRST* that targets children ages 6-9. Each team, usually consisting of 5-6 children, has to show their comprehension of science, technology, engineering, and math through challenges. With help from volunteer parent coaches, these children explore the concept of simple machines as they build a model made of LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> elements with a motorized part and present information relating to the year’s theme. This year the theme was Waste Wise. The children were challenged to find out what trash really means from reducing, reusing, recycling, and beyond. Each week, the 2nd Law Enforcers send mentors to collaborate with the children in order to help guide their thinking in solving various problems regarding the year's challenge.

# *FIRST* Lego League Junior Regional Expo
On January 31, 2016, teams are given the opportunity to display their achievements and ideas. They also participate in various STEM and theme-based activities. We, the 2nd Law Enforcers, organized the event with the assistance of members from other nearby FRC teams.
