The Books

Dream FIRST, founded by members of FIRST Robotics Team 178, began its mission to inspire young children to have an interest in science and technology through the publication of its first book, Meet Gizmo: The Start of a Journey. Since then, another book has been written and the program has greatly expanded. Read more about Dream FIRST at our about page.
